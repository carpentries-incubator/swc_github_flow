### Instructions for contributing with git and GitHub

##### Prerequisites and other options
- Editing requires a Github account. You can set one up at [https://github.com](https://github.com).
- If you don’t want to use Github, you can suggest changes by emailing a lesson maintainer

### Working from the GitHub webpage (graphical interface) 

##### Getting Ready:

1. Identify the url and repository name for the lesson you want to make changes for, eg [https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice](https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice). The main branch in all the Carpentry lessons is called gh-pages. 
2. It’s not possible to for you to directly edit the version of the lesson in the Carpentry repository, so the overall idea of “Github Flow” is that you can edit by making your own copy of the lesson repository, making a branch in your own copy, making the changes on that dedicated branch, and then sending your proposed changes back to the Carpentry version of the repository.

###### Have you already forked the repository for this lesson?

- If NO:
1. Fork a copy of the master repository (i.e. ```swcarpentry/<lesson-name>```) ```gh-pages``` branch into your account. Select the ```gh-pages``` branch, then use the Fork button:

2. When the “Where should we fork this repository?” screen appears, click on your Git username (or other organizational account, if you are a member of any other organizations on GitHub).

3. The lesson will then be forked into your repository.

- If YES: 
1. If you just made the fork, go on to Making Your Edits (ADD LINK).
2. If you made the fork a while ago, make sure it is up to date with the latest changes in the swcarpentry lesson repository before starting to edit.
3. Check the status of your repository - look if there is a message underneath the navigation bar, such as:
